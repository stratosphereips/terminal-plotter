# Interactive Console-based Time Window Plotter

Terminal Plotter is script that reads numeric data from a file (by default `data.txt`) and displays it as a live-updating plot in the terminal using [plotext](https://pypi.org/project/plotext/). The plot shows a moving time window (TW) of the data, and you can interactively adjust the window's size and position using keyboard controls.

## Features

- **Live Plotting:**  
  Continuously reads new data from a file and updates the plot in real time.
  
- **Moving Time Window:**  
  Displays only the last X data points (a configurable "time window").
  
- **Interactive Controls:**  
  Adjust the plot on the fly using these keys:
  - `k`: Increase window size by **1**
  - `K`: Increase window size by **100**
  - `j`: Decrease window size by **1** (minimum window size is 1)
  - `J`: Decrease window size by **100** (minimum window size is 1)
  - `h`: Move the window to older data (shift left) by the current window size
  - `H`: Move the window to older data by **100** points
  - `l`: Move the window to newer data (shift right) by the current window size
  - `L`: Move the window to newer data by **100** points
  - `q`: Quit the program
  
- **Auto-Scrolling:**  
  When the plot is showing the latest data (the last TW), new data automatically scrolls into view.
  
- **Legend Display:**  
  The plot includes a legend on top displaying the current time window length.

## Installation

1. **Python 3:**  
   Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your Unix-like system (Linux, macOS). This script uses the `termios` and `tty` modules, which are available on Unix.

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Install the `plotext` package using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install plotext
    ```

## Usage
Run the script from your terminal. It supports several command-line options:

`python a.py [--window WINDOW] [--file FILE] [--interval INTERVAL]`

## Command-line Options
`-w / --window`
Set the initial number of points in the moving window (default: 10).

`-f / --file`
Specify the path to the data file (default: data.txt).

`-i / --interval`
Set the refresh interval in seconds (default: 2 seconds).


## Example

### Run the script
First, Run the script with a 20-point window, reading from mydata.txt, and updating every 1.5 seconds:

  `python a.py -w 20 -f mydata.txt -i 1.5`


### Feeding Data to the Plot

The script reads numeric values from the data fileâ€”one value per line. To see the moving window effect, add data to the file using these example commands:

Test by appending single values by hand:

  ```bash
  echo "3.14" >> data.txt
  echo "4" >> data.txt
  ```

Test of plotting a ping command

    `ping www.toyota.co |awk '{print $7; fflush()}'|awk -F'=' '{print $2; fflush()}' >> data.txt`
